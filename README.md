# WebRTC Example
=============

This is a web application that allows you to video chat with someone else.
Just create a virtual room, share the link with someone and start a video chat.
The application also supports traditional web chat using text messages.

Written using JavaScript and Erlang.

### Tested with browsers

  - Firefox version 22 or later
  - Google Chrome version 23 or later

### Dependencies:

  - Erlang (http://www.erlang.org/download.html) 
  - Rebar (http://github.com/basho/rebar)

### Get the code:

    git clone https://github.com/fycth/webrtcexample.git

### Build

    cd webrtcexample 
    rebar get-deps 
    rebar compile

### Configuration

    vi etc/app.config

  signaler_listen_port - TCP port to listen on

    vi www/js/rtc_lib.js

  Edit first line  

  var wsURI = 'ws://www.webrtcexample.com/s';

  and change URL to [signaler_listen_host]

### Nginx

You should use NGINX >= 1.4 to make it work  
Edit your nginx configuraton file and add these lines into the website configuration:

    location /s { 
       proxy_http_version 1.1; 
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; 
       proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade"; 
    } 

### Run

    ./start.sh - to start in console 
    ./start_detached.sh - to start detached (in background)

Now configure your web server, point them on [www] folder as a 'root dir', and open your new web site.

### For Windows Users

    1. install erlang for windows 
    2. add path to erlang 'bin' directory to PATH environment variable 
    3. download 'rebar' and unpack it to a folder 
    4. start <rebar_folder>/bootstrap.bat - you will get 'rebar' and 'rebar.cmd' files in this directory after it finished 
    5. add path to the 'rebar' created executable to PATH environment variable 
    6. now we need to install Git on Windows. We can take it here: https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit 
    7. add path to msysgit 'bin' directory to PATH environment variable 
    8. go to webrtcexample folder and continue installation process according to the documentationrebar
